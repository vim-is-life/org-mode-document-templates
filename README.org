* What is this repo?
This is a repository containing various templates to make documents in different styles using Emacs [[https://orgmode.org/][org-mode]].
I try to do all my writing in org mode, and I decided that I would make my life easier by centralizing some of the skeletons that I use.
I myself am just a student, and am far from an org mode (or git/GitHub) expert, so pull requests, issues, and suggestions are welcome!
* Usage
1. ~git clone~ the repo and just copy the templates to the directory of your assignment whenever you need to.
2. Alternatively, ~curl~ or ~wget~ whatever template and (its respective preamble) you want and work that way.

Please note that these templates are optimized for PDF/LaTeX export.
You could probably still use these templates and do writing in them, and then make an ODT or a DOCX file with the default export capabilities or [[https://www.pandoc.org][pandoc]], if necessary.
You would just have to go through and fix the formatting of the document.

For citations, cross-referencing, and more, I highly recommend installing [[https://github.com/jkitchin/org-ref][org-ref]].
You can use the [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Citation-handling.html][new built-in citation system]][fn:1] for org mode (since version 9.5), but these templates are not optimized for it, as I couldn't get it to work for me yet.
* The =english-mla= Template
This template does its best to adhere to the Purdue OWL [[https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/mla_style/mla_style_introduction.html][guidelines for the MLA style]].

*** TODO add skeleton code for bibliography style with org ref
*** TODO add csl for mla8 to dir for org-ref and setup in preamble
* The =general-apa= Template
This template is for general documents that aren't required to fit any style.
It's named "general-apa" because should you /need/ to include the occasional citation or bibliography, this template can do so according to APA format [[https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/apa_style/apa_style_introduction.html][according to the Purdue OWL]].

This template does its best to adhere to the Purdue OWL [[https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/chicago_manual_17th_edition/cmos_formatting_and_style_guide/chicago_manual_of_style_17th_edition.html][guidelines for the Chicago Manual of Style, 17th ed]] (notes-bibliography).
