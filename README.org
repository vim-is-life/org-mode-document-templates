* What is this repo?
This is a repository containing various templates to make documents in different styles using Emacs [[https://orgmode.org/][org-mode]].
I try to do all my writing in org mode, and I decided that I would make my life easier by centralizing some of the skeletons that I use.
I myself am just a student, and am far from an org mode (or git/GitHub) expert, so pull requests, issues, and suggestions are welcome!
* Usage
1. ~git clone~ the repo and just copy the templates to the directory of your assignment whenever you need to.
2. Alternatively, ~curl~ or ~wget~ whatever template and (its respective preamble) you want and work that way.

Please note that these templates are optimized for PDF/LaTeX export.
You could probably still use these templates and do writing in them, and then make an ODT or a DOCX file with the default export capabilities or [[https://www.pandoc.org][pandoc]], if necessary.
You would just have to go through and fix the formatting of the document.

For citations, cross-referencing, and more, I highly recommend installing [[https://github.com/jkitchin/org-ref][org-ref]].
You can use the [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Citation-handling.html][new built-in citation system]][fn:1] for org mode (since version 9.5), but these templates are not optimized for it, as I couldn't get it to work for me yet.

Each template includes some dummy citations and a dummy BibTeX file so one can get have examples of how to cite works in org mode.
In all my templates I provide two macros called =bqstart= and =bqend=, which start and end blockquotes for LaTeX export.

You generally should not have to touch the =.preamble.org= files, but if you need customization, these are where packages are imported and page layout is setup.
*If you use pdfLaTeX to compile your documents, you will want to find your own solution for using Times New Roman font.*
I use ~fontspec~ and set the main font to Times New Roman in all but the =general-apa= template, so if you plan to use any of those templates, switch your compiler to XeLaTeX or LuaLaTeX.
* The =english-mla= Template
This template does its best to adhere to the Purdue OWL [[https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/mla_style/mla_style_introduction.html][guidelines for the MLA style]].
Be sure to put the title of your work in the *Title* section, as the title is used to make the title of the actual document.
Alternatively, you could just type in the title in the =#+begin_center= block yourself.
The same thing goes for the date, but with the *Author* section, input your last name, as I expand a macro holding the author to have the heading with last name and page number in the top right.

There are faculties provided to auto-generate your /Works Cited/ page, but should you need to edit it, you can edit the LaTeX specific parts.
* The =general-apa= Template
This template is for general documents that aren't required to fit any style.
It's named "general-apa" because should you /need/ to include the occasional citation or bibliography, this template can do so according to APA format [[https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/apa_style/apa_style_introduction.html][according to the Purdue OWL]].
